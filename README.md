# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: the improper handling of null values. The example showcases a function that correctly addresses null inputs, preventing potential runtime errors. The solution provides a robust approach to validating and handling nulls to improve the code's reliability and prevent unexpected behavior.

## Description
The provided JavaScript code presents a function (`foo`) that adds two numbers.  However, it explicitly checks for `null` values in its parameters, returning `null` if either input is `null`. This is a best practice to avoid runtime exceptions like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'valueOf')` when attempting operations on `null` values. The code includes test cases to show the function's correct behavior with both numeric and `null` inputs.
